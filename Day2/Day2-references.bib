  title     = "Using Historical Data With Bayesian Methods in Early Clinical
               Trial Monitoring",
  author    = "French, Jonathan L and Thomas, Neal and Wang, Cunshan",
  abstract  = "This article presents methods that were used to monitor two
               recent clinical trials for the early development of a novel
               therapeutic compound. We present Bayesian methods that were used
               to incorporate historical control data for monitoring early in
               the trials when there were very limited trial data. However,
               decisions to continue the study or terminate the experimental
               treatment had to be made to protect the patients in the trial.
               In the first trial, a pause in accrual was planned to allow
               assessment before a larger cohort could be recruited using more
               clinical centers. The primary endpoint for the continuation
               decision was binary, with accrual suspended until all patients
               in the first phase reached the endpoint time. The Bayesian
               method replaced decision criteria that regarded the historical
               data as a known standard, with the concurrent control data used
               to informally assist interpretation by the study clinicians.
               Monitoring of the subsequent study was planned without pauses in
               accrual. Survival methods used the partial information available
               on the eventual longer-term binary outcome. The Bayesian methods
               were approximately calibrated to avoid terminating the
               experimental compound incorrectly, and they were compared with
               some common, similarly calibrated non-Bayesian methods. The
               Bayesian methods were more likely to stop the experimental
               treatment correctly under conditions likely to arise in the
               trial.",

              models for censored survival data, with application to prognostic
              modelling and estimation of treatment effects",
  author   = "Royston, Patrick and Parmar, Mahesh K B",
  abstract = "Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox
              proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric
              models for such data may have some advantages. For example,
              non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models,
              may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of
              the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and
              log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines
              are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log
              cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow
              non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are
              introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale
              chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed.
              The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The
              results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the
              hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools
              described here may be a step towards providing greater insight
              into the natural history of the disease and into possible
              underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects
              by using the two examples in cancer.",
