* What makes TTE data different?  
  - Censoring
  - types of censoring: right, left, interval
  - most often we deal with right censoring
  
* Goal - estimation of the distribution of times to event
  - Mention we observe T* = min(T,C) but we are estimating cfd for T!!
  - To define a time to event variable we need a clearly defined time origen, a time scale, a well-defined event
  - Show example of enrollment into a trial vs analysis time and end-of-study censoring


* Due to censoring, we'll use the hazard function
  - define hazard in simple terms
  - show connection to density, cumumlative hazard and survival functions
   - importance of survival function
  -Almost always assume censoring is independent of event time
  ---> Workbook: Parametric functions
  
* Non-parametric estimation of survival, cumulative hazard and hazard functions
  - Kaplan-Meier (product limit) - basic ideas
  - Standard error of K-M
  - Nelson-Aalen estimator of CH
     - S(t) based on this is nearly the same but not identical
  ---> Workbook: survfit and muhaz, plotting vs categorical and continuouas predictors
  
* Summary measures of S(t)
  - Median
  - Percent surviving to time t
  - Restricted mean survival
  ---> Workbook
  
* Comparing two survival curves
  _ Measuring differences
      - difference in medians
      - difference in RMST
      - hazard ratio
  - Testing
      - log rank test
         - Tests Ho: S_0(t) = S_1(t) vs not equal
         - Equivalent to CMH test for binary data, where stratification is at unique event times
         - A good test when the hazard ratio is constant (but applicable even if it is not)
         - Most sensitive to late differences?
      - May also hear about rhe generalized wilcoxan test
         - most sensitive when early differences in survival
         - good when true distributon is log-normal or log-logistic
  ---> Workbook
  
* Modeling
 - Semi-parametric: Cox PH model
    - likelihood contributions for censored and observed events
    - Terminology: "Cox" model vs "PH" model (hint: no baseline hazard vs yes bl hazard)
    - We don't need to estimate h_0(t)!!
    - assumptions
 ---> Workbook
 
* Extensions to standard Cox model
  - Stratified Cox model
  - Time-varying covariates
  - (Demonstrate using supplemental workbook but no explicit hands-on)


*  Parametric
