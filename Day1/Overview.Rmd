# Why Start Here?

* The beginning is a very good place to start.
* Why start with GLMs?
* Why start with binary endpoints?
* Why time-to-event analysis?

----

# Why start with GLMs? Broadly Useful.

* `Binary` (the focus of this course)
* `Ordered categorical` (e.g. grade of adverse event)
* `Continuous`
    * bounded below (e.g. Lognormal residuals), 
    * bounded above and below (e.g. Beta residuals), 
    * unbounded (e.g. Normal residuals) 
* `Counts`
* `Time-to-event` (Many TTE models are GLMs, even though they are generally fit using slightly different machinery)


----

# Why start with GLMs? Mind-expanding.

* If you are coming from a Pop PK background, moving away from models with Normal (or log-Normal) residuals may force you to think at a new level of abstraction. 
* If you are not used to modeling in R and Stan, the `glm()` and `brm()` functions in R provide a good introduction, because they conform to somewhat standard R conventions for model-fitting functions. 


----

# What does this mean?
* Minimal NONMEMese
* $\eta$ is not what you're used to
* No $\sigma$ (For the most part)
* No random effects (to start)

----

# Why start with binary data?

* The Bernoulli distribution for binary data is (in most respects) as simple a statistical distribution as there is. Good place to start for many basic statistical concepts.  
* There are fewer choices to make and fewer assumptions to check when dealing with binary data (e.g. as compared to time-to-event data). 

---- 

# Course objectives

We want you to finish this course with: 

* General conceptual understanding and basic intuitions for the analysis of binary outcomes 
* General conceptual understanding and basic intuitions for the analysis of time-to-event data. 
* Specific tips, tricks, and recipes for getting the job done "soup to nuts".


----

# What this course isn't

* __Not__ primarily a course on R programming.
    * We expect a full range of experience levels. 
    * R techniques __not__ taught systematically "from the ground up"
    * Instead: __"copy and modify" / "learn by playing"__

* __Not__ a comprehensive course on the analysis of odd-type data
    * But, we will touch on most of the key concepts for analyzing binary and TTE data
    * Will get into more complex examples during the technical sessions


----

# Course organization

* Four 3-4 hour sessions
* Roughly one per week
* Didactic + hands-on learning
* Homework + "office hours"

----

# Session 1

* `Study designs and confounded exposure-response`
* `Basic concepts for binary data` : 
    * Notational conventions, Bernoulli distribution, Maximum likelihood
    * Visualizing relationships
    * Models, model checking, and measures of effect
    * Bayesian models for binary data (Technical session)
    
----

# Session 2
`Basic concepts for time-to-event data` : 

* Time-to-event (TTE) data:: what makes it different?
* Visualizing TTE data - the Kaplan-Meier estimator
* Cox proportional hazards model
* Introduction to parametric regression models

----

# Session 3
* `Advanced concepts for time-to-event data` : 
    * Bayesian TTE parametric modeling
    * Additional topics in TTE modeling
    * TTE models with a continuously time-varying hazard
    * Repeated time-to-event data
    * Markov models for analysis of longitudinal discrete state data

----

# Session 4
* `Even more advanced concepts for time-to-event data` : 
    * Joint modeling of continuous and time-to-event data (TD and TTE)
    * Modeling of treatment related AEs (neutropenia, diarrhea, etc)


----


# Course materials

* Each session has a slide set and a workbook.
* Navigate slides by first typing "t". 
* Workbooks are "Rmarkdown" documents. 
    * GUI button to execute a code chunk. 
    * GUI button to execute all prior code. __(Try this now. It will be useful if you mess up your data mid-session)__.
