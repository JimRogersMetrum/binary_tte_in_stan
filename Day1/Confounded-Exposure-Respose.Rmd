# Outline

* Introduction and example: Trastuzumab in mGC
* What is confounding?
* Why is it a problem?
* Thinking causally
* What are some solutions?

# Understanding exposure-response relationships is a key component of decision-making

For example,

* Sponsors: Dose-selection for future trials or registration
* Regulators: "Optimizing" benefit-risk in a population
* Physicians: "Optimizing" benefit-risk for a patient

# In some development programs, only one dose is studied extensively

* Common practice in oncology
   * Find MTD -> run expansion cohort (Phase 1b/2) -> Phase 3 

* Not uncommon in other disease areas
    * Expense of producing dosage forms or amounts
    * Success at MTD
    * "Fast to market" strategies

   
# With biologics this can cause a problem

* Observe an apparent exposure-response 
    * This may be real 
    * May be due to other factors

# ToGA: Trastuzumab in metastatic gastric cancer

ToGA trial demonstrated benefit of trastuzumab in mGC, but possibly less effective in patients with low exposure

* Phase 3, randomized, OL study
    * Fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin (FC) vs. trastuzumab + FC (T+FC)
    * Trastuzumab dosed with 'standard' regimen
    * Overall effect (top panel @Bang2010-lp)
    * By $C_{\text{min},1}$ quartile (bottom panel @Yang2013-tr)

Led to a trial designed to compare a standard and high-dose trastuzumab regimens.

# What happened?

* The apparent exposure-response in the ToGA trial was an artifact of <red>confounding</red>

* Subsequent analyses (@Yang2013-tr) confirmed the lack of an exposure-response relationship in the ToGA study.


<!-- # This observation is common with large molecules which are studied at one dose -->

<!-- << give other examples: T-DM1, tremi, vedo >> -->

<!-- * Why is this a particular problem for large molecules? -->
<!-- * Why is that compounded when studying a single dose regimen? -->


# What is confounding?

* Our primary interest is in the <red>causal</red> effect of exposure on an outcome.
   * _If we change exposure, how does the response change?_
* <red>Confounding</red> is a bias in the estimate of the causal effect.
* Occurs when there is a <red>common cause</red> of exposure and the outcome.

:::{.notebox}
Exposure-response confounding occurs when there is a common cause of exposure and the outcome of interest.
:::

# How does a common cause introduce bias?

* Suppose there is no relationship between exposure (E) and the outcome (O)
* There is one common cause (A) of both
* We can represent this in a _directed acyclic graph_ (DAG)

```{r,engine='tikz',echo=FALSE}

\tikzset{every node}=[font=\sffamily]
\node (v0) at (0,0) {E};

\node[align=center] (v2) at (0,-2)  {A} ;
\draw [->] (v2) edge (v1);
\draw [->] (v2) edge (v0);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

* This induces a relationship between exposure and outcome
    * Even though there is no causal effect of exposure on the outcome
    * _Association is not causation_

simulated_data <- tibble(
  A = rnorm(100),

__Weight:__ _baseline_ factor indirectly affecting exposure (through CL)

__Disease severity:__ _baseline_ factor directly affecting outcome and indirectly affecting exposure through an effect on CL

* Effect on CL through, e.g., cachexia -> inflammation and proteolytic activity -> high CL

* If we're not careful, baseline disease severity can confound the causal relationship between exposure and survival


# Why is this a problem?

* We want to know the __causal__ effect of exposure on the outcome.  
    - That is, if we change exposure how does the response change?

* The data going into these analyses are essentially observational.

* The common cause of exposure and outcome provides a <red>backdoor path</red> for information to flow.

Weight: baseline factor indirectly affecting exposure (through CL)  
Disease severity: baseline factor directly affecting outcome and indirectly affecting exposure 

* All of the variability in exposure is due to variability in CL
    * As a result, we can't block the backdoor path by controlling for CL
* Adding additional dose levels to the design is one solution

# Solutions when confounding is due to baseline factors

* Thinking about your estimand and potential confounding ahead of time  
    * Use DAGs to identify back door paths and how to block them without introducing other sources of bias

* Study design
    * Include multiple dose levels / regimens to de-couple CL and dose
    * Depending on the context, this may not be practical
    
*  Adjusted analysis
    * Regression models
        * Include effects of common causes in the model (even if they are not statistically significant!)
        * Be careful not to include common outcomes as a predictor
    * Matched analysis
        * Various methods for matching: propensity scores (PS), Mahalanobis distance
        * Can use machine learning or other non-parametric methods for building PS model

* Much more complex and DAGs don't provide a simple solution
* Need more sophisticated statistical tools
    * Marginal structural models + G-computation
    * Joint PK-TS or PK-TS-OS models
* Use early exposure measure (Dai et al., 2020)
* Incorporate mediating biomarker (e.g., tumor size) (Kawakatsu et al., 2020)
